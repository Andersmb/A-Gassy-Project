- Store data files and config files in the cloud with MongoDB

- In price plot, when mouse enters a plotted data point, then show the date corresponding
  for that fill

- Cumulative volume in report

- Help buttons for the report to explain what the numbers mean?

- Add possibility for adding a comment when adding new fills
  This means I also need to make a feature that "fixes" a data file and adds empty commends
  for the fills with no comments, to make the structure general.
